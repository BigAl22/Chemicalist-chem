This action made Matt nervous, as Russia and Africa both need items from each other and it could become an extremely beneficial alliance. Matt countered Alexei’s proposition and asked Greg if he would join their alliance, saying “All Alexei does is starve his people, and he’ll starve you like normal Africa”. Alexei then said if greg did not accept his proposition of an alliance, he would terminate greg’s website that he had made. Greg really liked the website, so he decided to ally with Alexei, forming the Soviet-African Alliance.</p></li>
